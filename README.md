# Countdown Timer

## Project Overview
The **Countdown Timer** is a simple web application that allows users to set a target date and time in the future and displays the remaining time until that moment. The timer dynamically updates and provides the countdown in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

- Real-time display of days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.
- Hover effects on the countdown numbers and logo for enhanced user interaction.
